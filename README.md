# 🎈 Medical Estimate Demo

A simple Streamlit app template for you to modify!

## 🚀 Deploy to Streamlit Community Cloud (Free!)

You can deploy this app for free on Streamlit Community Cloud so others can access it without you running the code. Here's how:

### Step 1: Push Your Code to GitHub
Make sure your latest code is pushed to this GitHub repository (you're already here! ✅)

### Step 2: Deploy on Streamlit Community Cloud

1. **Go to [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io/)**
2. **Sign in** with your GitHub account
3. **Click "New app"** button
4. **Fill in the deployment form**:
   - Repository: `gilibenita/medicalestimatedemo`
   - Branch: `main` (or your preferred branch)
   - Main file path: `streamlit_app.py`
5. **Click "Deploy"**

That's it! 🎉 Streamlit will give you a public URL (like `https://your-app-name.streamlit.app`) that you can share with your friend.

### Step 3: Share the URL
Once deployed, just share the URL with your friend. They can access it anytime without you needing to run anything!

### Optional: Custom Settings
If you need to configure the app, you can create a `.streamlit/config.toml` file for custom themes, ports, etc.
